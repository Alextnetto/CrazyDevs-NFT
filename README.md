# About

This is a NTF project made to learn, feel free to contribute. The project is deployed in Netlify, you can access [here][CrazyDevsLink]. 
Currently the ERC721 Smart Contract is deployed in Polygon Mumbai Testnet, this is why you can't see NTF's that already were minted or mint a Crazy Dev for you (unless you configure Polygon Mumbai network in yout MetaMask).

# Tools and tecnologies used 

 - [Figma] (Handmade art)
 - [Vite]
 - [React]
 - [Netlify] (Deploy frontend)
 - [Pinata] (IPFS)
 - [Ethers]
 - [Hardhat]
 - [MetaMask]
 - [Alchemy]
 - [Polygon]

# Step-by-step

## Creating and uploading the images

All the art was handmade, drawing different elements in each layer. Then I used a [script][NTF-art-generator-repo] to combine the 5 layers (pc, drink, hair, eyes and nose) and generate unique characters.

The images were uploaded to IPFS, using [Pinata][pinata].

## Creating the smart contract

I used [OpenZeppelin][openzeppelin] wizard to generate and extend the ERC721, that is a standard for NFTs in blockchains that use EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), created some functions, like payToMint and wrote some tests.

## Testing the smart contract

This Tutorial assumes you have installed nodejs and npm.

First install all dependecies
 
```bash
npm i
```

Compile and test

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

## Deploy the smart contract locally

We need a local EVM blockchain, open a second terminal and run
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
copy one private key, you will need it later.

In the first terminal, run the deploy script
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
it returns the contract's address

## Running the frontend

The app was built in React, using Vite. To run, use
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuring MetaMask to localhost

### Import account

Remember that private key you copied? In your MetaMask, go in "Import Account" and paste the private key.

### Connect in localhost network

Go in Settings > Networks, if you dont see a localhost network, add a network with these parameters:
 - Network Name: Localhost 8545
 - New RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
 - Chain ID: 31337
 - Currency Symbol: ETH

If you already have a localhost network configured, check if the parameters match with above.

## Minting your first Crazy Dev locally

Access http://localhost:3000/, click in "Mint", connect the app with your MetaMask, aprove the transaction and voli√°, now you have a Crazy Dev!

# Next steps

 - Get feedbacks and the deploy the Smart Contract in Polygon Mainnet
 - Record a YouTube tutorial
 - Use ERC1155

# Inspiration
Fireship is a awesome channel in YT, I inspired my self for this project beacuse of [this][fireship-ntf-video] video. I've been studying Blockchain and Web3 concepts and fundamentals since July of 2021, now it's time to practice and put it to work!!
